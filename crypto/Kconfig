config CC3XX_MUTEX_LOCK

	help
	  Enables exclusive access to the ARM CryptoCell hardware using an RTOS
	  mutex that has priority inheritance. The mutex lock is safe across threads
	  and/or interrupts with different priority. Using an RTOS mutex comes
	  at a cost of lower performance.

config CC3XX_ATOMIC_LOCK

	help
	  Using atomic operations is the fastest way to ensure mutually exclusive
	  access to the ARM CryptoCell hardware.

	  Warning: If this configuration is set, every execution requiring use of
	  the ARM CryptoCell hardware must happen in the same priority. Calling into
	  mbed TLS APIs from a higher priority while an ongoing operation will lead
	  to undefined behavior. It is highy recommended to to do all cryptographic
	  operations in one single thread if this configuration is set.

	  A mutual exclusive peripheral is the fastest way to ensure mutually
	  exclusive access to the ARM CryptoCell hardware on platform which support
	  it. The MUTEX peripheral is nRF53 platform specific solution.

	  Warning: If this configuration is set, every execution requiring use of
	  the ARM CryptoCell hardware must happen in the same priority. Calling into
